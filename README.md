 ## ‚ú® Features

- Show Your current playing song anywhere in your Javascript app.
- Show current lyrics as you hear it.
- Multiple variants
- Customisable.

### Initial setup. (Only needed once)

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard). You may need to login. Click on Create App button.
2. Fill information as you wish, just make sure your redirect URL is something which you can control. You will get 'Client Id' and 'Client Secret' from this step.
3. Open a browser window and go to the following URL, replacing CLIENT_ID and REDIRECT_URI with your own values.
```
https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&response_type=code&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI&scope=user-read-playback-state%20user-read-recently-played
```
4. If done properly, this should prompt you to Authorize the app using your Spotify account. Login to your spotify Account. You will notice the browser address bar replaced with (https://my-domain.com/callback?code=NApCCg..BkWtQ&state=34fFs29kd09). Note the value following "code=". This is your "Access Token" and you will need it in the next step.
5. Take your Client ID and Secret ID and put them in the format "CliendID:SecretID" and Base64 encode them (I used https://www.base64encode.net/).
6. Use your Base64 encoded Client ID:Secret ID, Access Token, and Redirect URI to run this cURL command.
```
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic BASE64_ENCODED_CLIENTID_CLIENTSECRET" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "grant_type=authorization_code&code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE&redirect_uri=REDIRECT_URI" https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token
```
7. If done properly, this will should give you your refresh token.
8. Import SPotifyNow Component and pass client_id client_secret and refresh_token as props with their respective values.
